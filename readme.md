# Metroid Prime: Hunters Anti Lag

This code helps to detect the lag in a Metroid Prime Hunters match by indicating when a player takes a hit. When a player takes a hit the code gives him Double Damage for a short time so the enemy knows if the shot hit or not. 


## Features

* User gets Double Damage for a short time whenever he takes damage
* Code ignores small damages like Magmaul or lava burn
* Shock Coil damage is not ignored
